This is the first blog post for basic C programming language tutorial.

- C is a high-level programming language that was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. 
- It is widely used for system programming and is the basis for many other programming languages, including C++ and Java. 
- C is known for its low-level access to computer resources and its efficient use of memory. It is often used to create operating systems, embedded systems, and device drivers, as well as other applications that need to interact directly with the hardware. 
- C programs are typically written in a text editor, compiled using a C compiler, and then executed on a computer. The syntax of C is similar to that of other programming languages, with elements such as variables, functions, and control structures.



### Advantages of c programming language
There are several advantages to using the C programming language, some of which include:

1. Portability: C programs can be easily ported to different computer platforms and architectures, making it a versatile language for a wide range of applications.

2. Efficiency: C is a low-level language, which allows for fine-tuned control over system resources and leads to efficient and fast program execution.
 
3. Standardization: C has a well-established standard, which ensures that programs written in C will be portable across different compilers and platforms.

4. Large libraries: C has a large and active user community, which has developed a wide range of libraries and tools that can be easily integrated into C programs.

5. Widely used: C is widely used in various fields like system programming, embedded systems, game development, and many more.

6. Pointers: C allows direct manipulation of memory through the use of pointers, which can be useful for low-level tasks such as memory management and data manipulation.

7. Easy to learn: C has a relatively simple syntax and is easy to learn for beginners, making it a great language for those new to programming

### The are also few disadvantages of C programming language.

- The most major of them is C isn't environment independent which means you can't run C program in any coding environment it has to be supported by GCC or GNU Compiler. 


- Another one is C doesn't support input/output statement. We have to use C library to get the input and output program done.
