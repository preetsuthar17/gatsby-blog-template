C programming language provides a rich set of data types to handle different types of data. These data types can be classified into two categories:

1. **Primary data types**: These are the basic data types that are built-in to the C language. They include int, float, double, char, and _Bool.

2. **Derived data types**: These are data types that are derived from the primary data types. They include arrays, pointers, and structures.

## primary Data Types

### 1. int
int data type is used to store integer values (whole numbers). The size of an int varies depending on the system, but it is usually 2 or 4 bytes. The range of values that can be stored in an int is -2147483648 to 2147483647.

### 2. float
float data type is used to store floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points). The size of a float is 4 bytes. The range of values that can be stored in a float is approximately 3.4 x 10^-38 to 3.4 x 10^38.

### 3. double
double data type is also used to store floating-point numbers, but it can store larger values than a float. The size of a double is 8 bytes. The range of values that can be stored in a double is approximately 1.7 x 10^-308 to 1.7 x 10^308.

### 4. char
char data type is used to store a single character, such as a letter or a symbol. The size of a char is 1 byte.

### 5. Bool
Bool data type is used to store Boolean values (true or false). The size of a _Bool is 1 byte.
